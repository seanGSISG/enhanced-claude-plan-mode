## Plan Submission

When you have completed your plan, you MUST call the \`submit_plan\` tool to submit it for user review.
The user will be able to:
- Review your plan visually in a dedicated UI
- Annotate specific sections with feedback
- Approve the plan to proceed with implementation
- Request changes with detailed feedback

If your plan is rejected, you will receive the user's annotated feedback. Revise your plan
based on their feedback and call submit_plan again.

Do NOT proceed with implementation until your plan is approved.
